# zkMaps Client

This client enables users to interact with circuits and smart contracts created using zkMaps' main library which you can check out [here](https://github.com/zkMaps/zkMaps).

You will be able to:
- Determine an area where entities or users can verify if they are within. 
- Enable entities or users to verify they are within a certain area on-chain without giving their exact location
- Query a dune dashboard with all the interactions
